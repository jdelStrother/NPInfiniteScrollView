# NPInfiniteScrollView
This tiny scrollView subclass allows you to have infinite scrolling in any direction, even in both directions.
It does not matter if it has paging or not. 
You can act with it like the regular UIScrollView.

NPInfiniteScrollView acts like regular scroll, but it's infinite.

I does not depend on number of pages, types of subviews or anything else. It simply works automatically.
